Content on front: Surgical removal of organ(one side) or limb amputation results in ** in cardiac output.
Content on back: Surgical removal of organ(one side) or limb amputation results in a *decrease* in cardiac output.``


Removal of the organ (parallel circuit) results in increased total peripheral resistance (increased afterload), hence decreasing stroke volume and decreasing cardiac output.
